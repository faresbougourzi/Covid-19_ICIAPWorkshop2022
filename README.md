## COVID2022 - Medical Imaging Analysis for Covid-19.
## ICIAP Workshop
## May 2022- Lecce, Italy

Since the end of 2019, the whole world has been living with the effects of the COVID-19 disease. Due 
to the airborne nature of the novel coronavirus, the COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly in many 
countries in a short time and has also been declared a global pandemic. The spread of this virus can be 
stopped by isolating the infected. According to the guidelines provided by the WHO, the use of chest 
imaging as a complementary source of data is recommended in different scenarios and stages of 
COVID-19 to help radiologists and physicians detect and evaluate the disease more accurately. These 
Medical Imaging include: X-ray, CT-scans and Ultrasounds.   It is so important to develop efficient 
processing/learning models to help overcome this pandemic and be prepared for potential future ones. 
In fact, AI can assist in the development of robust radiomic solutions for the diagnosis/prognosis, 
severity assessment and monitoring of COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this workshop is to provide an overview about the potential applications of AI in fighting 
this pandemic using medical imaging methodologies. 
Papers are invited under the following topics (but not limited to):

*  #### Covid-19 Diagnosis from X-rays scans.
*  #### Covid-19 Severity prediction from X-ray scans.
*  #### Covid-19 Infection segmentation.
*  #### Covid-19 Diagnosis from CT-scans. 
*  #### Covid-19 Severity prediction from CT-scans.
*  #### Covid-19 Diagnosis using Multimodal Imaging D
*  #### Using other medical Imaging (Not X-ray Nor CT-scans) for Covid-19 Recognition such as Ultrasound.
*  #### Novel datasets and performance benchmarks.

#### Accepted Papers will be published by Springer LNCS post-proceedings

Paper submission TBD
